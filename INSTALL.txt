To compile run

>make linux

or

>make darwin
(a darwin universal build should be included already)

or
>make win32

Copy the external to your path.

Make might complain the m_pd.h is missing. You can either change the Makefile to point to its proper place or copy it to the muug folder.

In windows make will look for pd.dll in c:/Arquivos\ de\ programas/pd/bin/, if PD is not installed there you should change that path.

The flags  -funroll-loops -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math
were added to the build since the object takes up a lot of processing power. Change them if their not appropriate for your machine.
